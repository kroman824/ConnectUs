            <h4>Self Awareness</h4>
            <p>Self awareness can improve our judgement and help us identify opportunities for professional development and personal growth. For instance, where an extrovert see's a sales position as a great opportunity to exercise their 'extrovert-type behavior' and introvert would most likely run the other direction, away from such a position. Awareness of your personality helps find situations in which we will thrive. and avoid situations in which we will experience too much stress.</p>
